#  Computer Vision projects
A collection of small Computer-Vision related projects for beginners.
## Camera Calibration:
The purpose is to calibrate a camera using a set of calibration images showing a chessboard in different positions, scales and angles.
## Image Filtering:
• Histogram Equalization:  Given an input image, the histograms for R,G,B channels are computed and then equalized. The equalized image is then showed. This process is also applied for the same image in the HSV color space.
• Filtering with trackbars:  Generate a denoised version of an image with three different filters (Median filter, gaussian filter and Bilateral filter). The parameters of the three filters are controlled by trackbars.
## Lane and Sign Detector
Segmentation of the street lane and the round street signs from an image using the Hough transform and Canny edge detector.
## Panoramic Image
Creation of a panoramic image given a sequence of unstitched images  using keypoints, descriptors and Matching technique.
## Object recognition and tracking
Detection and tracking a set of objects in a video using keypoints, descriptors and matching technique and the pyramid Lukas-Kanade tracker .
